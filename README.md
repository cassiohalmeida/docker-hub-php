There are __two parts__ of the documentation.

First, in the master branch, is this README.MD. It explains how this little scripts framework work and it is published on [Github page](https://github.com/ciandt-dev/docker-hub-php).

Second, in each image version there is an additional README.MD file that explains how to use that specific Docker image version itself. __*Latest version*__ is always the one seen on [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/ciandt/php).

We strongly encourage reading both!
